# SkyRoute
Abstract :

SkyRoute is a graph-based airline route optimization system that models airports as nodes and flight connections as weighted edges.

Each flight connection stores details such as airplane name, distance, ticket price, and number of halts.

The system utilizes Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute three optimal travel routes:

The shortest distance between airports.

The lowest ticket price route.

The minimum number of halts path.

It provides a structured approach to analyze and compare multiple flight options based on user preferences.

The project demonstrates the application of graph theory, data structures, and algorithmic optimization in solving real-world transportation problems.

It can serve as a foundation for developing intelligent systems in air traffic management, route planning, and logistics optimization.
